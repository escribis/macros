This directory contains macros for the modelio 3.x modeling environment. 
Some macros are also compatible with modelio 2.x releases.
See the header of each file for more information.

USAGE
-----
They are two ways to install macros
* (1) Installing each macro individually. Download the macro you want and use the "Add macro"
function of modelio. 
* (2) Installing all macros at once. This directory "macros" can be copied directly in your workspace. 
The file ".catalog" contains all definitions (".catalog" in Modelio 3.x, "script.catalog" in Modelio 2.x).
If you already have macros installed you will have to change this file manually.
Note that some macros requires the libraries. See the header of the macro for further explainations.
